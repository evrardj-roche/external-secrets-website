# ESO Website

## Contributing: Prepare for a new release

1. Ensure you can run run scripts/new-version by adding it into your go.work

go 1.25.7

use (
    .
    ./scripts/new-version
)

2. Run `go run ./scripts/new-version --project eso --version v3.0`. For reloader, replace `eso` by `reloader`.

3. Copy all the previous version files/add new version content. This will be further automated.

4. Test the build locally, commit and submit a new PR.
